# Functions
___
- [x] : **Section Completed**
___
> A function is a sequence of statements that performs a computation

> The expression within the parenthesis of the function is called the **argument** of the function 

> A function **takes** and arguement and **returns** a result 

___
### <u>Built In functions</u>: 

> The creators of python wrote a number of functions to solve common basic problems 

##### Examples :
- The `max`/`min` function can provide the largest/smallest character in a string or element of a list
- The `len` function states how many elements are in it's argument or the number of characters in a string

> Names of built in functions should be treated as **reserved words** 

___
### <u>Type Conversion Functions</u>:

> Used to convert values from one type to another

- `int()` : converts a value to an integer - if possible
	- **note**: this won't round a float it will just chop off the decimal
- `float()` : converts to a floating point number
- `str()` : converts to a string

___
### <u>Math Functions</u>: 

> The math module provides most common mathematical functions - it must first be imported : `import math`

> This will create a **module object** called 'math' 
> > The module object contains the functions and variables defined within the module
> > > In order to call a module function you must reference both the module and function name separated with a `.`

### <u>Random Numbers</u>:

> Another Module used to generate random variables

> With no arguments the `random()` function will return a random float between 0<1.0

> `randint` works similarly and generates a random integer between the `(low, high)` arguments provided 

> To choose a random element from a list or sequence the function `choice` can be used 
```python
import random 
list = [a, b, f, g]
random.choice(list)
```

___
### <u>Adding New Functions</u>: 

> A function definition consists of naming the new function and specifying the sequence of statements which execute when the function is called 
```python
def new_function(): 
	sequence of statements...
	...
```

___
### <u>Flow of Execution</u>: 

- Execution begins at the first statement of the program 
- Statements are executed one at a time from top to bottom
- Functions will be defined from top to bottom, however the statements within them will not be run until the function is called 
	- **important to remember** for example when a variable is defined within an earlier function and used later - causes issues
