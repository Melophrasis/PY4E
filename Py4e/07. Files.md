___
### <u>Opening Files</u>:

> In order to read or write a file it must first be opened

> Here the file being worked with is: [www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt]

> Note: Files can be downloaded into the current terminal workspace using `$ wget`

> The function `open()` is used to open the file
```python
text_file = open('mbox.txt')
```

> What is returned to the variable `text_file` here is not the file data but the **file handle** 
```python
print(text_file)

>>> <_io.TextIOWrapper name='mbox.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>
```

> The handle can then be used to read the data 

> **Note** : You will only be given a handle if the requested file exists AND you have permission to access it 

___
### <u>Text Files and Lines</u>: 

> Similarly to how a string can be thought of as a sequence of characters a text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines 

> In order to break a file into lines we must be aware of the **newline characeter** which symbolises this:
```python
\n 
```

> **Note** : Despite consisting of 2 symbols, \n is only considered to be **1 character** 

___
### <u>Reading Files</u>:

> Slightly confused here because it said before that 'fhand' is just the file handle and not the data
> But it seems we can perform operations on it without any further processing to access the text

> We can count the number of lines in the file: 
```python
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand: 
	count += 1
```

> When the file is initialled opened, it isnt read - as this may contain lots of data it just stores the handle 
> This means that the `open` statement takes the same amount of time to perform on any file 

> The `for` loop is what then causes the contents to actually be read

#### <u>Why a for loop</u>?

> Using a `for` loop is efficient for memory here because it reads each line in turn and then discards it
> > This reduces the load on the memory

> If you know the size of the file is small relative to your **main memory**, you can read it all as one **string** using  the `.read()` method
```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
inp = fhand.read()
print(len(inp))
94626
```

> Here the length given is the number of **characters** not the number of lines 

> **Note** : using read on `fhand` will 'exhaust' the resource
> I am not sure exactly what this means but it means in order to read the file twice you must open it twice
> Because of this you need to store the `read` operation in a variable, to prevent having to keep opening the file repeatedly 

___
### <u>Searching Through a File</u>:

> Normally when processing a file we wish to ignore most of the lines and only consider those that **meet a certain condition** 

##### <u>Example</u>:
We want to read a file and only print out the lines that start with 'From:'

> The method `.startswith()` can be used to select the lines based on the **target content**
> And a `for` loop to cycle through the lines
```python
fhand = open('mbox.txt')

for line in fhand: 
	if line.startswith('From:'):
		print(line)
```

> The output of this suprisingly contains line spaces between the extracted lines of text
```
From: chmaurer@iupui.edu

From: zach.thomas@txstate.edu

From: dlhaines@umich.edu
```

> While this is aesthetically desirable it is unexpected

> The effect is due to the **invisible \n** character at the end of each line in the text file
> Because the aquired text slice contains a \n character **AND** the print statement initiates a newline action there is this extra space

##### Solution 1: 
> We can use `rstrip` to remove the whitespace from the RHS of the string
```python
for line in fhand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if line.startswith
```
##### Solution 2: 
> We can use slicing to remove all but the last character

#### Scanning Using Continue:

> Continue could be integrated into the search:
```python
for line in fhand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if not line.startswith('From:'):
		continue
	# this skips the following body of loop
	print(line) 
	# only lines which start with 'From:' reach          the end of the loop
```


#### Using Find Instead of Startswith:

> The `find` string method looks for an occurence of a string within another string 
> > It will then either return the position index of the string if it exists / or **-1** if it is not found 

> This would be useful If we didn't know what the starting contents of the line was every time and wanted to target the email address extension specifically 

```python
for line in fhand:
	line = line.rstrip()
	if line.find('@uct.ac.za') == -1: continue
	print(line)
```

> Here, the `== -1` implies that when the string isn't located on the line, the output is -1 
> > If this is the case the remaining loop body is skipped using `continue`

##### Contracted Form of `if` Statement

> #Note : You can include a loop contents on the same line if it is a simple statement - works here because `continue` is the only item in the body
```python
if condition == True : Statement
```

___
### <u>Letting the User Choose the File Name</u>

> It makes more sense to ask the user to enter the file name so that it can be used on different files

>Simply add:
```python
fname = input('Enter the file name:')
fhand = open(fname)
```

> A `try` / `except` catch should be used in case an invalid name is entered

```python
try:
	fhand = open(fname)

except:
	print(f'That file does not exist: "{fname}"') 
	quit()
```

#### Quote:
><small><small><small>"Protecting the `open` call is a good example of the proper use of `try` and `except` in a Python program. We use the term “Pythonic” when we are doing something the “Python way”. We might say that the above example is the Pythonic way to open a file.
Once you become more skilled in Python, you can engage in repartee with other Python programmers to decide which of two equivalent solutions to a problem is “more Pythonic”. The goal to be “more Pythonic” captures the notion that programming is part engineering and part art. We are not always interested in just making something work, we also want our solution to be elegant and to be appreciated as elegant by our peers."</small></small></small>

### Writing Files:

#### <u>Initialising the File</u>:

> To write to a file - open with **mode "w"** as the second parameter
```python
fout = open('output.txt', 'w')
print(fout)
#<_io.TextIOWrapper name='output.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
```

**Warning:** if the file already exists its data will be cleared and a new file started, if it doesn't exist a new one is created 

#### <u>Writing to the File</u>

> Using the `.write()` method on the **file handle object** puts data into the file

> The default writing mode is **text** for writing strings 

> The file object will keep track of the file position, so `.write()` can be called again to add data to the end

> **Note:** unlike `print()` , the `.wite()` method does not automatically insert a newline \n at the end of each line 
> > Therefore if sequential write statements are desired to appear on seperate lines, the newline \n must be stated explicitly

```python
line1 = 'First line of text inserted\n'
fout.write(line1)
```

> Once the last alteration has been made, make sure to **close** the file to ensure the data is saved to the disk
```python
fout.close()
```

___
### Debugging

> Often writing issues involve **excess whitespace** 

> The function `repr()` can be used - it will take any object and represent it as a string **including whitespace characters** 

```python
s = '1 2\t 3\n 4'
print(repr(s))

>>> '1 2\t 3\n 4'
```

> Another issue may be that some systems represent newlines using a **return character** 
```
\r
```

> When moving a file between systems you might have to use a converter to fix this ``
