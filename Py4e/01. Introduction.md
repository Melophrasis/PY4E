| Component                | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU                      | Processes requests at the shortest timescale                                                   |
| Main Memory              | Stores information that the CPU may need fast access to - diappears on system shutdown         |
| Secondary Memory         | Slower storage of information ---- Able to store information between shutdowns, eg: Hard-drive |
| Input and Output Devices | Screen, keyboard, Mouse etc. Ways of interacting with computer                                 |
| Network Connection       | The slowest and least reliable form of information storage                                     |
> A program stores in advance the actions which the programmer wants the CPU to carry out 

___

### <u>Terminology: Interpreter and Compiler</u>

> Python is a **High-Level Language** 

> This is different to what the CPU actually receives

> The CPU understands **Machine Language** consisting of only 0's and 1's 

> High-level languages such as Python or Java convert programs into machine language for eventual execution by the CPU 

> **Machine Language** will be tied to a particular configuration of hardware and so is not portable between systems

> High level languages therefore also allow code to be **reinterpretted** or **recompiled** in a new context and therefore are **non-hardware specific**

#### <u>Interpreters</u>

> Read the source code of the program as the programmer writes them and performs instructions 'on the fly'
>> Eg: **Python**

> This allows a dialogue between computer and programmer

#### <u>Compilers</u>

> A compiler takes the entire program as a file, then processes the high-level code into machine language
> The compiler then places the resulting machine language in a file for later execution

<u>Eg: In Windows:</u>
- `.exe` - Executable 
- `.dll` - Dynamic Link Library

> Opening an executable in a text editor reveals an **unreadable** document

#### <u>Context to Python</u>

> The **Python Interpreter** is written in a high-level language called **C**
