# Lists
___
- [x] : **Notes Completed**
- [x] : **Questions Completed**
___
> Similar to a string, a list is a sequence of values however they can be of any type not just characters
> The elements in a list also dont have to be the same type

> In a list the values are called **elements** 

> A list which is located within another list is called **nested** and will still only count as a **single element** 

___
### Lists are Mutable

> This means you can change the order of items in a list or reassign their value by referring to their index
```python
numbers = [23, 67]
numbers[1] = 5
```

> A list can be thought of as a **mapping** relationship between indexs and elements 
> > each index **maps** onto one of the elements

#### <u>List Indices Rules:</u>

- Any integer expression can be used as an index
- If you try to read or write an element that does not exist it will produce an `IndexError`
- If an index has a negative value it counts backwards from the end of the list 

> The `in` operator can be used on lists to produce a boolean 
```python
cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
'Edam' in cheeses
True
```

___
### Traversing a List

> The easiest way to do this is using a `for` loop 
```python
for cheese in cheeses: 
	print(cheese)
```
> This method is useful mostly for reading the elements of a list 
> However if you want to write or update elements you will need their index number 

> This is often done using the `range` and `len` functions: 
```python
for i in range(len(numbers)):
	numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
```

> `Len` returns the number of elements in the list
> `range` returns a list of indices from 0 to n-1

> If the list in the for loop is empty the body will not execute

___
### List Operations

> Lists can be **concatenated** using **+** to create a single longer list featuring the items of both 

> Lists can be repeated using * to give a single list featuring the original a specified number of times

___
### List Slices

> Work the same as string slices
```python
list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
slice = list[1:3]
>>> ['b', 'c']
```
> What is returned is another list featuring the specified items


> Multiple elements of a list can be updated at once using slices on the LHS
```python
list[1:3] = ['x', 'y'] 
```
> Obviously the size of the slice and number of new elements specified must be **equivalent** 

___
### List Methods

#### 1. Append

> Adds a new element the **end of the list** 
```python
list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
list.append('e')

>>> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] 
```

#### 2. Extend

> Takes a list and appends all of the elements
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list1.extent(list2)
```

#### 3. Sort 

> Arranges the elements of a list from **low to high**


> **Note** : most list methods are **void** - they modify the list but return the value `None` 

___
### Deleting Elements

#### <u>Method 1</u> : `.pop()` 

> If you know the **index** of the element use the `.pop()` method
```python
list = [1, 2, 3]
removed_item = list.pop(1)
```
> `.pop()` modifies the list and returns the element that was removed 
> If no index is specified the last element is removed and returned


#### <u>Method 2</u> : `del`

> If you know the index and don't need to retain the removed value use the `del` **statement** 
```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
del t[1]
```
> `del` is also useful for removing more than one element by using a slice: `del t[0:2]`


#### <u>Method 3</u> : `.remove()`

> If you know the value of the element but not its index used `.remove()`
```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
t.remove('b')
```
> The **return value** for `.remove()` is `None` 

**Reminder** : the slice selects all the elements up to, but not including, the second index

___
### List Functions

- `len()` : returns the **length** of the list
- `max()` : returns the **highest value** in the list
- `min()` : returns the **lowest value** in the list
- `sum()` : returns the **sum** of the values in the list
	- (Only valid when list comprised of numbers)

___
### Lists and Strings

> A string can be converted into a list of characters using `list()`
```python
a_string = 'letters'
string_list = list(a_string)

>>> ['l', 'e', 't', 't' etc.]
```
> **Note** : Because `list()` is a built-in function it should never be used as a variable name

#### <u>Method</u> : `.split()` 

> A string can also be broken into a list of words using `.split()` method
```python
a_string = 'here is a sentence'
words = a_string.split()

>>> ['here', 'is', 'a', 'sentence']
```
> The `.split()` method features an option argument called a **delimiter** 
> This is used to specify which character to use as the **splitting point** between words
```python
a_string = 'this-is-split-diff'
delimiter = '-'
word = a_string.split(delimiter)
```


#### <u>Method</u> : `.join()`

> `.join()` is the **inverse** of split - it takes a list of strings and **concatenates the elements**

> **Note** : join is a **string method** - it must be invoked on the **delimiter** - the list is passed as a parameter
```python
word_list = ['Here', 'is', 'a', 'sentence']
delimiter = ' '
delimiter.join(word_list)

>>> 'Here is a sentence'
```

___
### Parsing Lines

> Normally we want to read through a line and locate an interesting part of it 

##### <u>Example</u> :
- Extract the 3rd word (day of the week) from lines in a document which feature the target word 'From'
`From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008`

```python
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
for line in fhand: 
	if not line.startswith('From'): continue
            
	words = line.split()
	print(words[2])       # takes the 3rd entry
```

___
### Objects and Values

> Identical strings will be treated as the same object
```python
a = 'bananna'
b = 'bananna'
a is b

>>> True
```
> Therefore both `a` and `b` refer to the same object


> However 2 identical lists will be treated as 2 separate objects 
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
a is b

>>> False
```
> Here we would say that the 2 lists are **equivalent** (contain the same elements) but not **identical** (not the same object)


#### <u>Object vs. Value</u> :

> An object possesses a value 
> For example `a = [1, 2, 3]` , `a` is the object which contains the value of a list of elements 
!!!!! i dont think this is correct or poorly explained at least
___
### Aliasing

> If you have `a` and you assign another object such that `a = b` then both variables refer to the same object

a ---> 'a string' <--- b

> When a variable is associated with an object it is called a **reference** 

> If an object has more than 1 reference, it can be called using more than 1 name - this object is therefore **aliased** 

> If the object is also **mutable**, any changes made in reference to one alias affect the value of the other 
> > This behaviour can be utilised however it easily leads to errors
> > For safety try not to **alias** mutable objects

> In the case of **strings**, aliasing rarely creates issues since they are **immutable** 

___
### List Arguments

> It is important to distinguish between operations that mordify lists and those which create new lists

> Example - the `.append()` method modifies a list whereas the `+` operator creates a new list

##### <u>Modify</u> :
```python
t1 = [1,2]
t2 = t1.append(3)

print(t1)
>>> [1, 2, 3]
print(t2)
>>> None
```
> Despite assigning a variable for the operation, no value is produced by the `append` action separate to the original list


##### <u>Create</u> :
```python
t1 = [1, 2]
t3 = t1 + [3]

print(t3)
>>> [1, 2, 3]

t1 is t3
>>> False
```

> It is important to bear in mind these effects when lists are passed as arguments into functions
> Depending on what type of operations are performed on it, a new list object may be created despite the original list being referred to

> It may then be better to return a new list as the output of the function rather than simply performing actions on the list variable

___
### Debugging

> **Remember** : Most list methods modify the argument and return `None` 

> So operations such as this are bad:
```python
t = t.sort()
```
> This will order the list in variable `t` however it will then assign to `t` the value `None`

#### <u>Correct Form</u> :

```python
t.append(x)
t = t + [x]
```

#### <u>Incorrect Form</u> :

```python
t.append([x])          # WRONG!
t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!
t + [x]                # WRONG!
t = t + x              # WRONG!
```

> So remember if using the `sort()` method, make a copy first to prevent losing the original list 

#### <u>Common Text Parsing Error</u> :

> If we were to check for the first word in each line using 
```python
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    if words[0] != 'From' : continue
```
> In the case of an empty line this program will crash, because you cannot called the `[0]` index of an empty list

> This problem is fixed by adding: 
```python
if len(words) == 0 : continue
```
