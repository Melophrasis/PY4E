# Dictionaries
___
- [x] : **Section Completed**
- [x] : **Questions Completed**
___
> In a list, the indices for elements must be integers 
> Whereas in a dictionary they are called **keys** and can be of almost any type

> Each **key** maps onto a specific **value** 
> The association of a key and a value is called a **key-value pair**

> The function `dict()` can be used to create a new dictionary
```python
eng2sp = dict()
```

> To add an entry to the dictionary, reference the dictionary name with the **key** name in square brackets
> > Then assign this to the value of the key 
```python
eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
```
> The key 'one' has been mapped onto the value 'uno'


> If you are creating a dictionary with values already:
```python
eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
```
> The order of the key-value pairs in a dictionary is the same as the order they were input to the dictionary 

> However the order is mostly irrelevant since values are obtained through reference to their key

___
### Useful Operations

- `len()` function : can be used to return the number of **key-value** pairs
- `in` operator : can be used to check whether an item is present as a **key** in the dictionary **but not** as a value
- `.values()` method : returns the **values** as a type
	- This object can then be converted to a list which the `in` operator can be used on if you are searching for a value

> **Note** : the `in` operator uses a different algorythm for lists/dictionaries
> 
> > For **lists** a **linear search** algorithm is used
> > > As the list gets longer the search time does too in proportion to the list length
> > 
> > For **Dictionaries** a **hash table** algorithm is used
> > > The operation takes virtually the same amount of time to perform regardless of the number of items
> > > [Hash_table](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

___
### Dictionary as a Set of Counters 

##### <u>Example Situation</u> : 

> You are given a string and want to count how many times each letter appears 

> A dictionary is a good method here, because each character type can be represented as a key and the count as the corresponding value
> It is also efficient because it means that we only count objects which appear at least once in contrast to if we stored every letter as a variable

```python
word = 'brontosaurus'
dictionary = {}
for letter in word:
	if letter not in dictionary:
		dictionary[letter] = 1
	else:
		dictionary[letter] += 1
```
> If the dictionary entry is not already present, it is created
> If it is present, its value is increased by 1

#### <u>Method</u> : `.get()`

> This method takes 2 arguments - a key and a default value

> If the key appears in the dictionary, `.get()` will return its value
> If the key does not appear it will return the default value

> This is useful in situations (like above) where we want to perform one action if the key doesn't exist, and another if it does

```python
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}

counts.get('jan', 0)
>>> 100

counts.get('tim', 0)
>>> 0
```

> This would allow for writing the previous exercise more concisely, since the `.get()` method automatically handles the instance where a key is **not in the dictionary** 
```python
word = 'brontosaurus'
dictionary = {}
for letter in word:
	dictionary[letter] = dictionary.get(letter,0) + 1
```

$----Instance----$
```python
dictionary['o'] = dictionary.get('o', 0) + 1
```
> If the key **doesn't** exist, the **default value** is returned `0` 
> If the key **does** exist, its value is returned

___
### Dictionaries and Files

> Dictionaries are often used to count the number of occurances of a word within a file

$----Example----$
```python
fhand = open('romeo.txt')
word_count = {}

for line in fhand:
	words = line.split()

	for word in words:
		word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
```

___
### Looping with Dictionaries

> The keys of a dictionary can be **traversed** using a `for` statement 
```python
word_count = {'breaks': 1, 'It': 1, 'is': 3, 'the': 3}

for key in word_count:
	if word_count[key] > 2:
		print(key, word_count[key])
```


#### <u>Keys in Alphabetical Order</u> :

> First you need convert the keys to a list 
> Then use the `.sort()` method
> Finally, re-associate the keys with their values
```python
word_count = {'breaks': 1, 'It': 1, 'is': 3, 'the': 3}
word_list = list(word_count)
word_list.sort()

for key in word_list:
	print(key, word_count[key])
```

___
### Advanced Text Parsing

> The previous text file had all **punctuation** removed 

> However, the `split()` function looks for space characters as the separation point between **tokens** 
> > This means the words 'soft' and 'soft!' as well as 'who' and 'Who' would create separate dictionary entries

> To do this, the **methods** `.lower()` , `punctuation` and `translate` can be used

#### <u>Translate Method</u> :

$----Documentation----$
```python
line.translate(str.maketrans(fromstr, tostr, deletestr))
```

> The characters in the `fromstr` will be replaced by the character in the same position in the `tostr`
> Any characters specified in the `deletestr` will be removed 

> If you don't want to replace any characters the `fromstr` and `tostr` can be assigned as **empty strings**

> To specify which characters to identify as punctuation we can import the `string module` and use the `.punctuation` call

$----String Module----$
```python
import string
string.punctuation

>>> '!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~'
```

$----Application----$
```python
fhand = open('romeo.txt')
word_count = {}

for line in fhand:
	rem_punct = line.translate(line.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
	line_final = rem_punct.lower()
	words = line_final.split()
	
	for word in words:
		word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
```
