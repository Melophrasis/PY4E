### <u>Values - Types</u>

> If you are unsure of the type of a particular value used `type()`


### <u>Variables</u>

> A variable is a **Name that refers to a Value**


### <u>Statements</u>

> A statements is a unit of code which the python interpreter executes


### <u>Operators and Operands</u> 

> Are symbols which correspond to forms of computation actions 

> The value which the operator is applied to is called the **operand**

eg: `+  -  *  /  **`

> In Python 3, division gives a floating point answer
> In order to obtain a 'truncated' integer result use **floored division** `//`


### <u>Expressions</u>

> An **expression** is a combination of **values, variables and operators** 


### <u>Order of Operations</u>

> If more than one operator appears in an expression the order of evaluation depends on the **rules of precedence** 

> The acronym **PEDMAS** can be used to remember the order

Parenthesis - Exponents - Multiply / Divide - Addition / Subtraction

> Operators with the **same precedence** are applied from **left to right**


### <u>Modulus Operator</u>

Symbol : **%**

> Works on integers and gives the **remainder** when the **first** operand is **divided** by the **second**

> Can be useful particularly for checking if one number is divisible by another eg: if `x % y` is zero 

> Can also be useful for obtaining the **right-most** digit/s of a number 
> eg: `x % 10` give the last digit of a number, for more digits use greater base eg: 100 etc.


### <u>String Operators</u>

> When the **+** operator is used on a string, **concatenation** is performed instead of addiction 
> This joins the strings end-to-end

> Strings can also be repeated a number of times using the `*` operator


### <u>Mnemonic Variables</u>

> Mnemonic mean 'memory aid'
> This is when variables are named in a way which assists the reader of the code as to the meaning or function of the variables
