### <u>While Loops</u>:

> A basic form of python iteration to deal with repetitive tasks

<u>While statement execution flow:</u>
1. Evaluate the condition to give `True` or `False`
2. If the condition is `False` --> exit while loop 
3. If the condition is `True` --> execute the body and return to step 1

> Each time the body is executed is called an **iteration** 

> The body of the loop should modify a variable so that eventually the condition evaluates to `False` and the loop terminates

> The variable which changes and controls when the loop finishes is called the **iteration variables** 

#### <u>Breaking the Loop</u>:

> Option 1 is to alter a variable until the condition evalutes to `False` 
> Option 2 is to use the `break` statement to exit the loop

> This can be useful as it means the loop can be exited at any point rather than at the top (where the condition is) 
> Additionally it means the stop condition can be specified precisely rather than 'when this point is reached' 
> > or in other words the logic of the stopping point doesn't have to follow the same line as what causes the loop to continue iterating


#### <u>Finishing Iteration Early</u>:

> If you are in the middle of an iteration but want to skip to the next without finishing the body of the current loop use the `continue` statement 

<u>Example</u>:
```python
while input != 'hello'
	print(blah)
	print(blah2)
	
	if input == 'goodbye':
		continue
		
	print(blah3)
```

### <u>For Loops</u>:

> A `for` loop is a form of **definite loop** as it will loop through a known set of items and will only have as many iterations as there are items in the set

<u>Example</u>:
```python
total = 0
for itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:
    total = total + itervar
print('Total: ', total)
```
