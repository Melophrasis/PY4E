# Strings
___
- [ ] : **Section Completed**
___
> A string is a sequence of characters which can also be viewed like a list 

> The characters can be accessed using brackets 
```python
fruit = 'bananna'
letter = fruit[1]
```
> remember indexing starts at **0** for the **first letter**

___
### <u>Length of String</u>:

> `len()` is a built in function which returns the number of characters in a string
> Remember however if you want the last letter of the string that it will be **[len(string) - 1]**

> Alternatively the last letter of a string can be found using the index `[-1]`

___
### <u>String Traversal</u>: 

> Often when working with a string you will want to process the string one character at a time from beginning to end
> This process is called a **traversal** 

> This can be done using a **while loop** 
```python
fruit = 'bananna'
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(letter)
    index = index + 1
```

> Or using a **for loop**
```python
fruit = 'bananna'
for character in fruit:
	print(character)
```

___
### <u>Slicing Strings</u>:

> A slice is a section of a string longer than a character

Form: [n : m] - where n is the starting character and m is ending

> Note this will include the first character and exclude the last 

> Excluding the first value `[:x]` will start from the beginning
> Excluding the second value `[x:]` will continue to the end

___
### <u>Strings Are Immutable</u>:

> This means you cannot change the value of a character in a string simply by referring to its index
```python
string = 'hello'
string[0] = j
!!!!ERROR 
```
> String objects do not support item assignments

> You would have to create a new string with the alteration and cut out the changed character using slices

___
### <u>The In Operator</u>:

> `in` is a boolean operator 
> It takes 2 strings and returns `True` if the first is present as a substring of the second
```python
>>> 'a' in 'banana'
True
>>> 'seed' in 'banana'
False
```

> Other Comparison operators can be used on strings such as `<` / `>`
> When applied to strings this will compare the alphabetic order of the first character
> > **Note** this will prioritise capital letters first 

___
### <u>String Methods</u>: 

> A string is an example of a python **object** 

> An object contains data - the information such as the string itself
> As well as **methods** which are functions that are built into the object and are available to use on any instance of the object 

> The function `dir` lists the **methods** available for an object
> The function `type` shows the **type** of an object

<u>Finding Out About Methods</u>:
> After listing the methods for an object you can find out more information about what they do by referring to the type of object and the method in question: `help(str.capitalize)`

> A call to a method is called an **invocation** of the method

#### <u>Some Methods</u>:

> The method `.find()` can be used to locate characters or substrings
> The first argument is the substring to find and the second is the index to start from: `string.find('na', 3) `

> The method `.strip()` is used to remove the whitespace from the beginning or end of a string

> The method `.startswith()` is used to check whether a string starts with a particular value 
> > it returns a **boolean** 

> Many methods are **case sensitive** so it can be necessary to use `.lower()` first 

> The method `.count()` is used to count the number of times a substring occurs in a string 

___
### <u>Parsing Substrings</u>:

> Often we want to analyse a string to look for a particular substring

##### <u>Example</u>:

Find address extension in string: 
`'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'`
> First we find the position of the @ sign:
```python
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'
atposition = data.find('@')
>>> 21
```

> Next we find the position of the space after the address: 
```python
spaceposition = data.find(' ', atposition)
>>> 31
```

> Finally slice the string using these 2 positions: 
```python
address = data[atposition+1 : spaceposition]
```
