___
> Methods encountered so far have been simple, because searching and extracting files is so common python has a more powerful module called **regular expressions** 
> These methods are more **difficult** syntactically

```python
import re
```

___
#### <u>Method 1</u> : `search()`

```python
se.search('sub_string', target)
```
> This returns information about the search - not just a **boolean**however it can be used to affirm an `if` statement for example

> This is a **trivial use** since the the `.find()` method could have easily been used instead
```python
target_string.find('sub_string')
```
> **Note** : this would output `0` for a match or `-1` for no match - these can again be used to affirm **truth tests** 

> The power of regular expressions come from their ability to add **special characters** which more precisely control which lines match the search 
> > This can then allow for more sophisticated searching with only a few lines of code

> The language of these **special characters** is consistent across the different methods within the **regular expressions** module - once learned very powerful and cross compatible

<center><h3>Character Matching in regex</h3></center>
___
#### <u>Caret Character</u> : `^`

> Tells the expression to match for the **beginning of the line** 
```python
ex_string = 'this is a sentence'
re.search('^this', ex_string)
```
> This will only match lines which **start with** `'this'` 
> **Note** : we include the `^` character within the quotes


#### <u>Period Character</u> : `.`

> Matches to **any character**  

> **Example** : `'F..m'` - would match any word which is 4 letters and starts with an `F` and ends `m` (Fxxm, F!@m etc.) 
```python
ex_string = 'this is a sentence'
re.search('t..s', ex_string)
```


#### <u>Repetition Characters</u> : `*` | `+`

> The **asterisk** `*` matches **zero-or-more** occurances of the **preceding** element

> The **plus** `+` matches **one-or-more** occurances of the **preceding** element

> These are powerful when combined with the **period** `.` because we can then state that the string can be followed by any number of undefined characters eg: `.+`

$----Example----$
```python
ex_string 'From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za'
re.search('^From.+@', ex_string)
```
> The term `.+` will expand to include any number of characters of any type between `'from'` and the `'@'`

##### <u>Greedy / Pushy Nature</u> :

```
"From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za, csev@umich.edu, and cwen@iupui.edu"
```
> Both the `+` and `*` characters are considered **greedy** because they will not stop at the first instance of @ 
> > The entire string up to  `cwen@iup...` will be matched by this search 

> The 'greedy' nature of these expressions can be switched off with further characters

<center><h3>Data Extraction Using Regex</h3></center>
___
#### <u>Method</u> : `.findall()`

> `.findall()` will make a list of any items which match the **standard expression**
> Can be used to extract all **substrings** which match a **regular expression** 

> The methods will be applied to this **case_text**: 
```
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
Return-Path: <postmaster@collab.sakaiproject.org>
          for <source@collab.sakaiproject.org>;
Received: (from apache@localhost)
Author: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
```
> We would like to extract any email address regardless of the line format

```python
case_text = (see above)
e_list = re.findall('\S+@\S+', case_text)

>>> ['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za', '<postmaster@collab.sakaiproject.org>', ...]
```
- The `\S` character matches to **any non-whitespace-characer**
	- By placing it on **either side** of the `@` we will extract the entire email address and stop extracting once a **space** (whitespace) character is encountered
- The `\S+` implies that there must be **at least one** **non-whitespace** character before and after the `@`
	- This means a '@' sign on it's own will be ignored 

___
#### <u>Specific Character Matching</u> : `[x-y]`

> **Square brackets** `[]`are used to indicate the set of **acceptable characters** which the expression should consider matching
> > `\S` can be thought of the **set** containing all non-whitespace characters

> In the previous example, there maybe scenarios where the email address looks like `<james@fuckurself.com>` since < counts as a non-whitespace character

##### <u>Character Set</u> : `[a-zA-Z0-9]`

> By substituting this into the expression we are saying that we only want to match the **lower-case characters**, **upper-case characters** and numbers **0-9** 
```
[a-zA-Z0-9]\S*@\S*[a-zA-Z]
```
- we search for **substrings** starting with a character in the range `[a-zA-Z0-9]` 
- followed by **zero-or-more** non-blank characters `\S*`
- followed by a `@` character
- followed by **zero-or-more** non-blank characters `\S*`
- followed by a character in the range `[a-zA-Z]`

> Since our character set counts as a character we have changed from `+` to `*` because we are already forcing there to be a character at the start and the end within our specified range

<center><h3>Combining Searching and Extracting</h3></center>
___
___
> Suppose we wanted to only extract the **floating point** numbers from strings which start in a particular way:

#### <u>Example 1</u> :

$----Case-Study----$
```
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000
```

$----Regular-Expression----$
```
^X-.*: [0-9.]+
```
- `^X-` : the line must start with 'X-'
- `.*` : followed by **zero-or-more** characters of any kind 
- `: ` : followed by a **colon** and a **space**
- `[0-9.]+` : followed by **one-or-more** characters which are either a **number** `0-9` or a **period** `.` 
	- **Note** : Inside the brackets the `.` functions as a literal period character than than as the any-character wildcard 

#### <u>Parenthesis Character</u> : `()` 

> The previous example would output the lines which match our expression, however we would like to just extract the numbers which match our expression

> When **parentheses** are used in a **regular expression** they are ignored in the string matching, however they indicate that you are only interested in **extracting** the portion of the expression which is enclosed by the **parenthsis**

$----Regular-Expression----$
```python
x = re.findall('^X-.*: ([0-9.]+)', line)
```
> By enclosing the section which specifies the number in **parentheses** only this will be extracted into the **list** collected by `.findall()`

___
#### <u>Example 2</u> : 

> Given data of the form: 
```
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
```
> Extract the **Hour** of the email reciept

$----Standard-Expression----$
```
^From.* ([0-9][0-9]): 
```
- `^From` : matches lines which start with ''From" 
- `.* ` : followed by any number of characters and a **space**
- `([0-9][0-9]):` : **parentheses** signify this is the piece of data to be extracted - **2 numbers** followed by a **colon**

___
#### <u>Escape Character</u> :

> Since certain symbols are used as **special characters** by the regular expressions module, we we would like to literally search for the symbol character and not use it's symbolic function we must use the **escape character** 

> To signify this use the **backslash** `\` character 
> Eg: `\^` , `\$` etc.

<center><h3>Special Character Summary</h3></center>
___

- `^` : Matches the beginning of the line.
- `$` : Matches the end of the line.
- `.` : Matches any character (a wildcard).
- `\s` : Matches a whitespace character.
- `\S` : Matches a non-whitespace character (opposite of \s).
- `*` : Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times.
- `*?` : Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times in “non-greedy mode”.
- `+` : Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or more times.
- `+?` : Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or more times in “non-greedy mode”.
- `?` : Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or one time.
- `??` : Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or one time in “non-greedy mode”.
- `[aeiou]` : Matches a single character as long as that character is in the specified set. In this example, it would match “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, or “u”, but no other characters.
- `[a-z0-9]` : You can specify ranges of characters using the minus sign. This example is a single character that must be a lowercase letter or a digit.
- `[^A-Za-z]` : When the first character in the set notation is a caret, it inverts the logic. This example matches a single character that is anything _other than_ an uppercase or lowercase letter.
- `( )` : When parentheses are added to a regular expression, they are ignored for the purpose of matching, but allow you to extract a particular subset of the matched string rather than the whole string when using `findall()`.
- `\b` : Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.
- `\B` : Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.
- `\d` : Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9].
- `\D` : Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to the set [^0-9]
