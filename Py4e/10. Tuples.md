# Tuples
___
- [x] : $Completed-Notes$
- [x] : $Completed-Questions$
___
> A **tuple** is similar to a list in that it is a **sequence of values**

> These **values** can be any **type**

> **values** are indexed by **integers**

> Tuples are **immutable** - their values cannot be altered
> Tuples are also **comparable** and **hashable**

> Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as _data structures_

$----Definition----$
```python
tup = ('a', 'b', 'c')
```

> **Note** : if the tuple only features one element, you must still include a comma **,** `tup = ('a',)`
> Otherwise `('a')` will be treated as a **string**

#### <u>Tuple Function</u> : `tuple()`

> To construct an **empty tuple** assign to `tuple()` function
> Obviously assignment to just `()` will cause issues for **zero item tuples**

> If the argument to the `tuple()` function is a **sequence** (string, list, tuple), a tuple is created using the elements if the sequence
```python
t = tuple('string')

>>> ('s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g')
```

> Most of the same operators from lists work on tuples

##### <u>Tuple List Similarities</u> :

- Bracket operator : [x] to reference indexes
- Slice operator : [:] to select range of elements 

> Elements in a tuple cannot be modified
> However you can replace a tuple assigned to a variable with another - can be used as a form of updating
```python
tup = ('A',) + t[1:] 
```
> This would effectively replace the first entry of the tuple by creating a new object

___
### Comparing Tuples

> Comparison operators can be used on tuples and **other sequences**

> Python will compare the first element initially, if they are equal it will proceed until a difference is found 
> > Once a difference is located the comparison will be evaluated 
> > So even if the following value after the difference would give a drastically different result - only the **first point of difference** is important in deciding the outcome 

$----Examples----$
```python
(0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)
>>> True

(0, 1, 200000) < (0, 3, 4)
>>> True
```
> As we see, even if the overall value of the sequence is vastly greater , only the first point of difference is considered 


#### <u>DSU Pattern</u> :

> Is a style which utilises this function of comparison operators

- **Decorate** "a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence"
- **Sort** "the list of tuples using the Python built-in `sort`"
- **Undecorate** "by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence"

> **Re-explained** : A method for processing data by storing it in a tuple which contains a piece of distinguishing information as well as the data to be reclaimed at the end

##### <u>Example</u> :

> **Goal** : organise a collection of words from longest to shortest

1. 
$----Decorate----$
```python
txt = 'but soft what light in yonder window breaks'
words = txt.split()
decorated_list = []
for word in words:
    decorated_list.append((len(word), word))
```
> Here each word is given a tuple featuring it's **length** as the first entry

> Remember you need to enclose both terms so that only 1 item is present in `.append()`

> This then allows the resulting **list** of tuples to be **sorted** resulting in a list ordered in terms of **word-length**

2. 
$----Sort----$
```python
t.sort(reverse=True)
```
> This sorts the elements from **longest** to **shortest** because the first element of each tuple is a **number** signifying the length of the string

> Is an example of the `reverse=True` **argument** 
> > I imagine this is a commonality for other **methods** to the effect of reversing their effect

3. 
$----Undecorate----$
```python
res = []
for length, word in t:
    res.append(word)

>>> ['yonder', 'window', 'breaks', 'light', 'what', ...]
```
> **Important** :  remember if you are looping through the elements of a list, but the list contains **nested tuples** (or other lists) you can reference both in the first line of the loop
> `length, word` refers to the items `(len(word), word)` in the originally created list. 

$----Alternative----$
```python
res = []
for item in t:
  length = item[0]  # Access first element (length)
  word = item[1]    # Access second element (word)
  res.append(word)
```
> Clearly this method is less efficient

___
### <u>Tuple assignment</u> : 

> You can unpack tuples easily into multiple variables
```python
m = ('a', 'b')
x, y = m

>>> x = 'a' 
>>> y = 'b'
```

> This applies to other sequences such as **lists** also
```python
m = ['a', 'b']
x, y = m

>>> x = 'a' 
>>> y = 'b'
```

> It would also be valid to write this as `(x, y) = m` since this is a tuple ??? but when there is a tuple on the LHS it is stylistic to omit this

> This rule means that it is possible to swap the **values** of 2 **variables** in a **single statement**
```python
a, b = b, a
```
> Both sides of this statement are **tuples** 
> However the **left side** is a tuple of **variables** 
> the **right side** is a tuple of **expressions** 

> This means the expressions on the RHS are evaluated before assignment to their respective variables on the LHS

> **Note** : the number of **variables** on the LHS and **values** on the RHS must be the **same** 

> The right side can feature any kind of sequence eg: string, list, tuple

$----Example----$
```python
address = 'monty@python.org'
uname, domain = addr.split('@')
```
> Here, the `.split()` method generates a list with **2 values** 
> These are then assigned to **2 variables** in the same line 

___
### Dictionaries and Tuples

> The **method** : `.items()` can be used on **dictionaries** to return a **list** of **tuples** !!!! See "important" further down for addition - not strictly a list but a **view-object**

> Each **tuple** in this list is a **key-value** pair

> Due to the non-sequential nature of dictionaries the items are **unordered**
> However since tuples are **comparable** the resulting list generated from `.items()` can be **sorted** 
```python
d = {'b':1, 'a':10, 'c':22}
t = list(d.items())

>>> [('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]
```


### Multiple Assignment in Dictionaries

> The previous methods enable an **efficient** way of **traversing** the elements in a dictionary
```python
d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
for key, val in d.items():
    print(val, key)

>>> 10 a
	1 b
	22 c
```
> For each **entry** in the dictionary `d`, the key is assigned to the **variable** `key` and the **value** to `val` since `d.items` produces a list of tuples
> eg: rotation 1 of the `for` loop : 
```python
key, val = ('a', 10)
```

> If we then wanted to **sort** the dictionary entries based on **value** we just need to swap the order of the entries in the list of tuples
```python
l = []
for key, val in d.items():
    l.append((val, key))
l.sort()

>>> [(1, 'b'), (10, 'a'), (22, 'c')]
```

> **Important** : `dictionary.items()` does not **strictly** convert to a **list**, it actually produces a "**view object**" 
> > In many situations (like above) this is sufficient however there are key differences

##### <u>View Object vs. List</u> :

> The view object will reflect changes made to the dictionary
> So for example, if we were making changes to the dictionary within the loop this would be inappropriate since the view object would be changing 
> > In this case it is necessary to convert `dictionary.items()` into a list using `list(dictionary.items())` because this produces a **static snapshot** of the dictionary at the start of the loop
> > However since above we are only extracting the values into a separate list it is not necessary, **however this is a subtle point which could cause issues**

___
### Using Tuples as Dictionary Entries

> A **composite key** is one in a dictionary which features multiple data points

> Because **tuples** are **hashable** and lists are not, a tuple must be used to generate a **composite** dictionary key

##### <u>Example</u> :
<center>"A telephone directory which features first/last name pairs with the phone numbers as values"</center>

```python
directory[last,first] = number
```
> Where `directory` is the **dictionary**, and the expression in brackets : `[last,first]` is a tuple 

> In order to refer to the value of an element of the dictionary the full tuple must be referenced: `directory[last,first]`

___
### <u>Sequences Overview</u>

> Lists, tuples and strings can be used in combination with each other in infinitely complicated configurations

> Choosing which sequence of values is more appropriate is a matter of situation 

1. In some contexts it is syntactically simpler to use a tuple, such as in `return` statements
2. If you want to use a sequence for a dictionary key it **must** be a **tuple**
3. If you are passing a sequence as the argument into a **function** it can be safer to use a tuple - reduces risk of unexpected behaviour resulting from **aliasing**

> **Note** : because tuples are **immutable** they cannot be used with **methods** such as `.sort()` or `.reverse()` 
>> Python's built in functions `sorted()` and `reversed()` must be used instead --> return a **new sequence** of the re-ordered items rather than modifying the original 

___
### List Comprehension

> A more advanced method for generating items based on loops

##### <u>Example</u> :
>"if you wanted to convert a list of strings – each string storing digits – into numbers that you can sum up"

$----Method-1----$
```python
int_as_str = ['53','23','2354']
converted_list = []
for x in int_as_str: 
	converted_list.append(int(x))
```
> This does the job but is quite long-winded

$----Method-2----$
```python
int_as_str = ['53','23','2354']
converted_list = [int(x) for x in int_as_str]
```
1. `int(x)` : state the **operation** to be performed on the entries
2. `for x in` : outline the loop structure
3. `int_as_str` : reference the list to be **traversed**
